This project aims to analyze the movements in the value of the Canadian dollar compares to the Japanese yen.

Using the historical CAD-JPY exchange rate [data](https://github.com/AmiraAli23/Time-Series/blob/b21ce2716b3864b392d8a299ee14875ef1653915/cad_jpy.csv), we performed time series forecasting and linear regression modelling to draw conclusions regarding the two currencies.
